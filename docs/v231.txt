=======================
What's new about v2.3.1
=======================

The only things that have  changed  from  v2.3 to v2.3.1 are some of
the docs have been updated, and a few minor changes in the source to
remove a few minor  compiler  warnings  that  occur  on  a  few  odd
compilers.

I'm also including details of the record breaking 1 billion digit pi
run.

Performance  is  still  the  same as v2.3, since it's still the same
program.
