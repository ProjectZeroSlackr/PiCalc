Although  there  have  been a few porting problems, my v1.5 and v2.x
line of programs have been  surprisingly  bug free.  There have only
been a few problems.

Only the latest program version is supported.  It just doesn't  make
sense  to  fix  bugs  in  old  versions  when  the source is readily
avialble.


v1.5
----
None known at release.


v2.0
----
v1.5 ceases being supported.

Fresh release.  No bug fxies, obviously.


v2.1
----
v2.0 no longer being supported.

The ntt32/generic/modmath.h ModMul()  in  v2.0  was  buggy.   Fixed.
Reported by Keven Acres.

Only known  bug  in  shipping  version:   'Big  Endian'  bug in disk
version.  Reported by Dara H.

v2.2
----
v2.1 no longer being supported.

Fixed v2.1's 'Big Endian' bug.  Wasn't  endian related at all, but a
stupid optimization on my part in the ReadNumIntoBuf().  The fseek()
should always be done, but I did it conditionally.

Known  shipping  bug:   unable  to  get  it  to  work correctly with
2.81(??)  of DJGPP.  Reported by MLee.

v2.3
----
v2.2 no longer being supported.

Fixed v2.2's problem with GCC 2.8.1

Fixed memory leak in  virtual  memory  caches.   (How the heck did I
miss that?!)

Fixed major  alignment  problem  in  gcc586/vector.c.   It  caused a
massive performance  penalty  on  Pentium+  class  processors.   Not
really a bug, but considering the speed penalty, it might as well be
called that.

No known shipping bugs.



If you need to contact me,  you  can  reach  me  at  my  Juno  email
address.   Be  aware that Juno has limitations on size etc., so keep
messages under 30k of content.  If you want to send me stuff, let me
know  in  advance!   And  you'll have to send it uuencoded, cut into
about 30k each.  No MIME, no  attachments, etc.  I try to answer all
my mail within a week, so if  you  don't  get  a  response,  then  I
probably didn't get it.
