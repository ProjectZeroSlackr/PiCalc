This includes, but is not limited to:

  common/ini.c            By me.  Public domain.

I retain all legal rights and ownership.  All files are provided "as
is", without any warranty, suitability of use, etc.  These files and
programs are being provided in  the  interest of sharing of a hobby.
If you do not agree to these terms, then do not use them.

I give you permission to use these as needed, without asking me  for
permission,  informing me of your use, or any form of payment.  Feel
free to use them if you need to.

I do, however, have one restriction and one requirement.

First,  you  must  not put the GNU license (often called 'Copyleft')
onto this product or any code,  data, docs, etc. that you extract or
develop directly from it.  You can, of course, do what you want with
your own original code, docs, data,  etc.   Just as long as it's not
mine.

Second, you must include a  notice in your code and/or documentation
that the ideas or code came from me.  I've put a lot  of  work  into
these  and  it's  just  fair  that  my  name  is  included  in there
somewhere.  You don't have  to  provide  a massive explanation, or a
copy  of my original code, although you can if you wish to.  But you
need to include some notice  that  I was involved somehow.  On major
projects, I try to give credit where it's due, because it's fair.  I
just  want  you  to  do  the  same.   Being  included  in  something
comparable to my list of "thank you's" would sufice.

Beyond those two things, you can do whatever you want.  You can even
market it commercially, if  there  was  actually  a  market  for  pi
programs.  (Baring any other licensing  restrictions  of  any  other
code that might be included, of course.)

[Non-legal personal note:

Just in case you are curious, the reason  this  entire  thing  isn't
public  domain is because I have indeed put a lot of work into these
programs (more than a thousand hours) and I just  want  to  be  sure
that  if somebody does use these in their own stuff, that my name be
included.  Perhaps  that's  ego.   Or  perhaps  that's  just 'fair'.
Whichever it is, though, that's the main reason it's not all in  the
Public Domain.

As for the restriction...

To be blunt, I don't like the GNU license.  The concept is good, but
I don't like the actual license.  I think it's restrictive, and  far
far  more  complex  and difficult to read than it needs to be.  I've
tried several times to read  and  understand it, and there's so much
legalesse  in  there  that  my  eyes  glaze  over.   Maybe   Richard
Stallman's  brother  is  a lawyer or something, I don't know.  But a
complicated, unreadable license like they  use goes against the very
concept the Free Software Foundation claims to stand for.  In short,
I don't approve of the GNU license  and I don't want any part of it.
If they really believed the things they claimed, they would have  at
least  attempted  to  make  the  license  readable  by  the  average
programmer.
