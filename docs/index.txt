If you need to contact me,  you  can  reach  me  at  my  Juno  email
address.   Be  aware that Juno has limitations on size etc., so keep
messages under 30k of content.  If you want to send me stuff, let me
know  in  advance!   And  you'll have to send it uuencoded, cut into
about 30k each.  No MIME, no  attachments, etc.  I try to answer all
my mail within a week, so if  you  don't  get  a  response,  then  I
probably didn't get it.
