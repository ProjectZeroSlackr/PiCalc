This is just a demonstration of a Fast Galois Transform.

A FGT is  a  cross  between  a  'complex'  FFT  and  a NTT.  It uses
'complex' arithmetic, but the numbers are modular rather than real.

This is just a  simple  demo  of  a  FGT.   Although  it  works,  it
certainly can't be called fast or 'complete'.

This particular one  happens  to  be  semi-hardwired  for the 2^89-1
mersenne prime.  The stuff in modmath, sys_cfg, etc. are only  three
elements.   Most  of  the  stuff  in  bigmul.c and fgt.c themselves,
though, is fairly generic.  (Exceptions  are putting the data into &
extracting the data out of, the FGT.)
