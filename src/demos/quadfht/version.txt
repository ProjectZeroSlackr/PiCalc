A basic 'wide' FHT.  Uses Bailey's quad precision float.

Be aware that I make NO  guarantee that the Fortran->C conversion is
100% correct.

For the full Fortran code, see Dr. Bailey's web page at:

It's worth  pointing  out  that  during  some  testing,  the  output
function  managed  to get into an infinite loop!  Whether that was a
bug in my conversion  or  the  Fortran  code  or some sublety that I
missed, I don't know.  You might want to check the original code  if
you plan to do anything serious with this idea.
