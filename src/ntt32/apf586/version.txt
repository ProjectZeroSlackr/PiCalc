This version is  the  31  bit  NTT  that  is  specific  to the DJGPP
compiler and is optimized for the Pentium processor.

It uses Mikko Tommila's APFloat six step table based transforms.

On a Pentium, the speed up over the 486 version is substantial.

It requires the FPU be in 'long  double' mode.
