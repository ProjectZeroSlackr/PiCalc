Not all of these are actually useful, working version.

ntt64:
  Just an example of a single NTT

nttdwt:
  I started on doing a DWT  version  of a NTT (like Colin suggested)
  but I never finished it.  Non-working.

splitfft:
  I started to add Jason's split radix FFT, but I  didn't  get  done
  with it.  Non-working.

bernie:
  Just some experimentation with some Newton routines.  Out of date.
  Probably non-working by now.

karnfft:
  Another  experimentation  with  another FFT.  Didn't get done with
  it.

widefht:
  Was going to customize  the  'DEMOS'  version but I can't remember
  exactly what I was working on.  Nothing  important,  but  I  don't
  think its a working version.

galois:
  Experimenting  with  a  Fast  Galois Transform.  Like in the DEMOS
  directory, except I was doing something new.  Can't remember what.

DEMOS:
  The stuff in the 'demos' directory  does work, but are slow.  They
  are just 'proof of concept' code.  Some of the code is  very  very
  slow.

NTT32:
  Same old ntt32 stuff, except I added Mikko Tommila's 6-step NTT in
  there, too.  All working.

FFTSTUFF:
  Same old FFT stuff.  All working.
